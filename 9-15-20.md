# Research Project!

## Name Generator

Everyone is expected to do some at home research about specific topics presented by Bob at the end of class.
The next morning Bob will use a random name generator to pick the lucky few.
  -Hope, Todd & Brendan were "chosen"
  -The topic was JS Data types

# Variables

[Slides](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/variables#anchor/changing_values_example)

## Assigning Variables

A variable is a name for a value using an assignment operator -_Let_ declares the variable and accounts for all scopes while also being the most common, while _Var_ doesnt always respect scope
Pick good names and dont use single letter variables, this is so you can read your code as well as others -_Let_ also allows you the change the variable, while _const_ wont allow for reassignment -**Variable names cannot have spaces or dashes and are case sensitive**
You can only use _let_ once per variable,
camelCase is the industry standard for variable naming, however snake_case and kebob-case are also sometimes used.
Variable names should be small and concise

## Warehouse Mataphor

If your computer memory is a giant Indiana Jones style warehouse of data, Variable names are the labels on the the boxes that help you find what you are trying to access.

## LAB: Play In Concole

[theLab](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/variables#anchor/lab_play_in_console) is a variable changing lab

## Pointer Metaphor

Think of variables as arrows pointing to values

## Changing Variables

Reassignment only changes the name of an object. It does not change the data inside the object, similar to removing a label from one box and placing it on a different box.

## Pointers can point

You can create multiple variables that point to the same thing.

## Return Values

Most messages return new values, you can add methods to new variables while the original will remain the same

## Changing Values

Most messages dont change the data inside an object, This is true for all strings, since strings in JavaScript are immutable. Any message that transforms a string will return you an entirely new string, but some messages **do** change the contents!

## Changing Values Example

[Date](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/variables#anchor/changing_values_example) uses the built-in Date method

# Strings

## String Literals

a _string literal_ is a string whose characters are spelled out explicitly in your code and is surrounded by single or double quotes

## String Escapes

Some characters cant be typed literally, so string _escapes_ are used to denote that the next character is special
i.e. backslashs can be used to insert new lines, add some punctuation and also create pathways(more on this later)

## String Messages

Strings understand lots of messages
[MDNDoc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) for more on strings

## Slice

Strings are made of other strings and can be manipulated.
THe *Slice* method allows you to pull out parts of a string
    -*Dont forget that a string is **0 indexed***

## Characters

a character is a number (or character code) that stands for a symbol.

## ASCII and Unicode
ASCII is the American Standard Code of Information Interchage and was created in 1963.
ASCII character representation goes from 0-127.
Unicode goes much higher and continues to grow. Its 130,000+ characters include modern and historic scripts, mathematical, currency and cultural symbols, and emojis
-**JS strings are Unicode**

## Comparing Strings

-Strings are compared one character at a time using the Unicode values of each character.
-In both ASCII and Unicode, all uppercase strings are less than all lowercase strings.

# Numbers

## Number Operators

- \+ Addition
- \- Subtraction
- \* Multiplcation
- / Division
- % Modulus ("remainder")
- \** Exponent

## LAB: Playing With Numbers

- [numberPlay](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/numbers#anchor/lab_playing_with_numbers)

## Order of Operations

-Use parentheses explicitly, you shouldnt create doubt in you math

## LAB: one nation, divisible

- [divisibleNation](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/numbers#anchor/lab_one_nation_divisible)

## Strings and Numbers

While numbers can manipulated and changed (ie 1+2=3), strings are added on (ie "1" + 2 = '12')
Even though Strings and Numbers are different TYPES, JavaScript converts one to the other.
As a programmer, you must explicitly declare which one *wins*

## Type Conversion

### Number to String
- use the `.toString()` method
### String to Number
- Easiest and cleanest is `unary +`
-[stringToNumber](https://coderwall.com/p/5tlhmw/converting-strings-to-number-in-javascript-pitfalls) for more examples

## Type Coercion

JS will try to covert types for you, but usually not the way you would like unless you specifically instruct the program to do so.

## Radomize It!

`Math.random()` is a method that allows you to make things unpredictable with numbers. 

## Math is hard

There are many types of numbers that can be used in many situatuions:
  - Natural numbers (counting)
  - Integer numbers (naturals, negatives, zero)
  - Rational numbers (fractions and ratios)
  - Irrational Numbers (numbers that cannot be written as simple fractions)
  - Complex numbers (imaginary numbers used with real numbers)
  - Imaginary numbers (numbers that is used within an equation that is not real but satisfies the equation)

## Floating-Point Numbers

JavaScript numbers:
  - use decimal notation
  - are stored in binary
  - have a fixed bit-length

# Null

## Null is Useful

Null is a **falsy** value that means there is no value
Null can be used as a place holder, or a 'nothing yet' scenario, and as a guard clause in your program

## Null Errors are good

Errors tell us:
  - There is a mistake somewhere,
  - What ths mistake is,
  - and often how to fix it.

## TypeError explained

"TypeError" is an error about data types.
"Cannot read property" means there is no such property
"of null" is the value you were using
This error is confusing because the reason and location of the error is at the end of the message

## Null Pointer Errors

Very Common Error
The trick is reading the error to determine:
  1. Where (which line)
  2. Which variable is null
  3. Why it was null

## Failing

2 Failure Philosphies:
  1. Fail fast, Fail Hard
    - good for programmers
      -exposes errors early
      -forces critcal thinking
      -provides helpful info about why it failed
  2. Keep calm and carry on
    - good for users
      -context is easier to read
      -user can still use program

Both are useful

## JS's Nulls
  -`null` means nothing,
  -`undefined` means "I dont know"
  -`NaN` means Not a Number
  -`''` means an empty string

# Functions

## What are they
Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again. Functions can be "called" from the inside of other functions.

They are named just like variables, but make sure they are concise.

You can call a function by using it's name plus `()`
  -`function add(numOne, numTwo)` would be called by using `add()`

## Functional Labs

[divisibleNationTwo](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/functions#anchor/lab_one_nation_divisible) divisional booleans

[capitalize](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/functions#anchor/lab_capitalize) using some slicing and dicing to capitalize a the first letter of a string

## Passing Variables to Functions

When you pass a variable to a function, that variable's value is assigned to a parameter.

## The Four Functional Syntaxes

1. Function Declation syntax - the most common - `function variable(x) {Do stuff}`
2. Function Expression - `let variable = function(x){Do stuff}`
3. Arrow Function Expression - `let variable = (x) => {Do Stuff}`
4. Arrow Function Expression w/ Implicit Return Value - `let variable = (x) => Stuff`

Outside of the functional declartion, the other functions "name" is the variable it points to

## Moar Labs

[ageCalc](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/functions#anchor/lab_age_calculator) lab to create an age calc

[supplyCalc](https://bootcamp.burlingtoncodeacademy.com/lessons/javascript/functions#anchor/lab_supply_calculator) lab of how much you need for a lifetime supply
